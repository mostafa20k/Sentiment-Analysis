            "Text: this is a well manufactured product , i can see it withstanding a lot of abuse ( minus the power adapter which is of pretty average quality ) . the tone is great , very little coloration of the initial sound with an incredibly responsive eq and a decent notch filter . i bought this thinking i wouldn ' t use the sonic maximizer but it works great to even out the sound when strumming . its a little hard to describe what exactly it does , other than just brightening up the sound ( think taylor style tone ) thus far ive used a martin ooo-28ec ( passive k&k pure mini ) and an 000c-16gte ( fishman prefix , active with preamp ) with it and had great results . my one complaint about it comes with using it with a low output passive pickup . cranking the volume past halfway starts to throw out a nasty 60hz hum , luckily it has sufficient gain to compensate , which with a low ouput pickup won ' t really distort the sound much , and you can minimize the hum , though its still definitely there . ( note this is out of the 1/4 output i haven ' t tried the xlr yet , though i doubt it would be much different )\n",

            "Text: i really liked this pedal . i liked it much better than boss bd-2w waza craft i also tried in comparison . the bd-2w had a bit of fuzz where the clarksdale remained articulate in the way it broke up , giving a deep , reverberating breakup instead of a muddy , fuzzy overdrive . really a matter of preference , i suppose . with the 3-band eq , the clarksdale was also far more flexible than the bd-2w . personally , i think that ' s worth the extra $50 over the boss pedal . i really preferred the clarksdale over the tubescreamer it roughly emulates for all the reasons it was designed and is marketed . however , this said , i wound up returning the clarksdale and settling on the far more expensive empress multidrive instead . one reason is that , for some reason , in conjunction with the wampler ego compressor ( my favorite pedal ) , the clarksdale was very noisy . i wouldn ' t characterize the clarksdale as noisy for an overdrive by itself by any means , but when paired with the ego compressor , it was a bit over-the-top noisy . far more noisy than the empress multidrive in direct comparison , and with a lot less overall flexibility . if i eventually want that fuzzy breakup the blues driver has , i can easily get it with the multidrive by adding the fuzz channel , but the clarksdale won ' t go there . . . by design . that said , i ' m certain the multidrive will not give me exactly what the clarksdale did on it ' s own either , but it sure does play nicer with my compressor and gets me pretty close . i can play the multidrive and the ego compressor at the same time without a noise gate for a really fat tone , but certainly couldn ' t with the clarksdale without going hum crazy . i ' m pretty certain that someone who doesn ' t mind ( or enjoys ) owning lots of different overdrive pedals for different purposes would happily find a place for the clarksdale in their collection , and since it offers a lot more flexibility and a more articulate overdrive , it could replace their tubescreamer altogether . however , i ' m trying to limit the number of pedals i have lying about collecting dust , and i felt the multidrive does that better , even if it ' s not quite as great as any one thing ( though that in itself is strongly arguable because the multidrive is a great sounding pedal ) . so , i think the clarksdale is a five-star overdrive pedal , but it lost a star because it doesn ' t seem to play very nicely with one of it ' s own cousins in the wampler family , and that ' s important because the ego compressor has become an always-on pedal for me .\n",

            "Text: this is a nice small sized low-feature powered mixer , for when you just need to mix a few inputs and maybe play some music . it stacks on top of most 10 and 12 cabs , giving a simple and clean interface for transport and set-up at a small venue . nice design , simple and intuitive layout , overall it looks like a great product for a simple 1 or 2-man type coffee shop gig , or for a house party . the output is an advertised peak of 200 watts , but the manufacturer ' s rating is 2-channels , 30w/ch at 8 ohms ( 60w peak/ch ) , 50w/ch at 4 ohms ( 100w peak/ch ) . so for someone like me who wants to hook up two 8-ohm speakers , it will put out about 60-80 watts program ( 30 per channel ) . the input on the back says 120v / 40w , so i suspect it probably generates < 20w/ch rms power / 80w program / 160w peak at 4 ohms , despite their clever ( deceptive ? ) advertising . i didn ' t measure the output power on mine yet , but expect it ' s running from a 12v supply rail ( 36w rms into 4 ohms per channel , or 18w rms into 8 ohms per channel ) . with two cheapo kustom 10 speakers it turned up to 110dbc @ 1m , which is more than enough for what i need regardless of the watts . despite the lowish power , you can do a lot with 50-60 watts if it fits your application . the fidelity is good , with no clipping or distortion until the led level meter indicates it . it has a built-in limiter too , which is convenient . all that said , i had to return mine since it was defective . i hooked it up and immediately noticed a quiet crackling noise coming from my speakers , like someone was rustling a snickers wrapper into a microphone . with all the input gains turned down , it still made a very audible crackling through all 4 input channels on both amp outputs . i hooked up the mp3 player and ran some sound through it to see what would happen , and it actually had pretty decent sound . the crackling was drowned out by the music , but after stopping the player the crackling was again audible . it was not a hiss sound like broadband noise , but it actually sounded like a mic cord was hooked up ( none were ) and had an intermittent short or something . it happened on all 4 input channels , but the mp3 channel didn ' t seem to be effected . weird . i was tempted to open it up and check for bad solder joints or misplaced components along the mix bus , but as it ' s brand new i opted not to and just sent it back for an exchange . once i get the replacement in , i ' ll update the review , but i ' m expecting this unit was just bad or defective in some way , and is not representative of the intended design . it sounded good enough in the short test i did to get me excited about it , and i plan to use it for some low-key acoustic gigs once i get a working model . as things are , this mixer was built in china and shipped around the world to get to me . i expect some level of quality control problems with this type of cheap gear , so i don ' t get too upset if something shows up not perfect on first power-up . peavey will fix it , or the retailer will replace it if it ' s defective . the cost of 100% initial qc vs 99% initial qc is a very steep increase , and while i admire top-tier gear makers and often purchase top-tier equipment , sometimes i just need something small and cheap to beat around and don ' t mind the trade-off of occasionally getting a bum unit . the design looks to be a sturdy one if you get a working unit , the transformer is beefy and well mounted , and the circuit boards are all secured to the chassis securely . the pots and knobs are circuit-board-mounted , so if you hit them hard enough you could potentially damage the circuit board . they are recessed behind the chassis frame to help avoid that problem in normal use , and the knob has a close fit gap to the face plate so it shouldn ' t stress the board too much . but if you ' re hard on gear or are touring / gigging a ton you might look for something with face-mounted pots . bottom line if you need something portable for a couple mic ' s or instruments at a small venue , this might be a good option . don ' t count on 200w of power , think more like 50-60w if you ' re using 8-ohm speakers , or 80-100w if you ' re using 4-ohms . aside from the noise defect my unit had , it sounded flat and clear , true-to-life , as i expect from peavey gear . the reverb is junk , i wish they ' d just have made it an aux or fx bus instead of the junk reverb and waste of a knob . i may mod mine to replace the reverb with an insert style fx bus sometime in the future , so i can use vst effects .\n",

this is your deal . i strongly disagree . you can find much better distortions for $100 or less , even a few near or under the $40 mark the ds-1 is currently priced at . i ' ve played guitar for over 10 years . like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the ds-1 . afterall , everyone talks about them , they ' re available at any given music store in the nation , you hear about all these famous musicians using them , plus a ds-1 is actually pretty cheap ! so i snapped one up just like everyone else . come to find out that just because something is popular , that doesn ' t always mean its good ( see nickelback , the transformers movie franchise , the kardashian family , etc . . . ) . so i plugged it in and didn ' t really care for it . the distortion was harsh , thin , artificial sounding and always noisy . i tried it on both my amps ( my practic amp a solid state fender frontman 25r , and my big amp , the b-52 at100 , which is a 100w tube halfstack ) it was was not very diverse , and the basic sound was not very likeable to me . i ' ve read the japanese made ds-1 ' s are better in sound than the newer , made in taiwan models but , either way , the ds-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind . but , like many newer players , i didn ' t know any better at the time . fast forward a few years and i ' ve bought and sold literally dozens of pedals . there is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open . so here are some pedals i currently own that i like much better than the ds-1 . all of them are great general purpose distortions , easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops , and can , at the time of this writing , be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol ' amazon . com , and are rugged enough to last for years <a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/boss-ds-2-turbo-distortion/dp/b0002czv8c/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8>boss ds-2 turbo distortion</a> lest i catch any flames from people thinking i ' m a boss hater ( i ' m certainly not , i loved the tu-3 , the odb-3 , the md-2 , and the xt-2 , among others ) i ' ll start with the ds-1 ' s big brother . this pedal has a much nicer tone to it , not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes . the i setting is pretty much a higher quality ds-1 , the ii setting is a brighter , richer tone . as the ds-1 completely overshadows the ds-2 in popularity , you can find ds-2 ' s all over ebay for very cheap prices . a very worthy pedal , unfortunately overlooked by many . <a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/pro-co-rat2/dp/b0002msqvq/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8>pro co rat2</a> great dirty distortion pedal . probably my personal favorite . you ' ve heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years , its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists . its a rich , full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy . i ' ve never heard a bad tone out of mine . its great for getting a big amp kind of sound out of a small practice amp . its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume . a truly excellent pedal . <a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/ehx-little-big-muff/dp/b000t517y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8>ehx little big muff</a> the big muff is another pedal you ' ve heard on hundreds of songs . its kind of a fuzz , kind of a distortion , but definitely owns its own sonic territory . very big , saturated and warm . used heavily in the 70 ' s for classic rock tones , also in the 90 ' s and beyond for tons of grunge and garage . used by everyone from carlos santana and david gilmour to the smashing pumpkins , dinosaur jr . and jack white . i personally reccomend the little big muff , not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent nyc reissue , its smaller , uses a regular 9v adapter and its cheaper ! a great pedal . <a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/mxr-distortion/dp/b0002e520c/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8>mxr distortion +</a> the distortion + is a great first distortion , and can usually be found pretty cheap . whats nice about the distortion + is that it sounds great on anything , and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent , i . e . you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp , it doesn ' t cover over your equipments sound . used by quite a few famous folks , including the greatful deads jerry garcia , randy rhoads ( ozzy ' s famous guitarist ) and steve jones of the sex pistols . <a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/danelectro-cm-1-cool-cat-metal/dp/b000a40nai/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8>danelectro cm-1 cool cat metal</a> make sure you get the cool cat metal , not the metal ii . that ' s a fine pedal as well , but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal . the cool cat metal , or cm-1 , is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals . basically , its a pre-amp that sits on the floor . it has a fully adjustable eq with tons of volume and gain through the roof . so you can do anything from a clean boost ( with the gain at minimum there is virtually no coloration to your tone ) to high gain metal stuff , with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between . it works well with any amp i ' ve tried it on , and you can find tons of great sounds . its an unbelievably versatile pedal , and its even true bypass . the best part is , danelectro seems to have made way too many of them , so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30 . a true hidden gem that ' s actually cheaper than a ds-1 . <a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/joyo-jf-03-crunch-distortion/dp/b005lyiw3w/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8>joyo jf-03 crunch distortion</a> this little guy surprised me . its supposedly a clone of the mi audio crunch box , and , if so , that must be one awesome pedal too . its essentially a marshall stack in a box , and boy does it ever succeed at that . great crunch , tons of volume and gain , it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin ' stack ! it even sounded good going into my modeling amp ( very few pedals work well with my modeling amp , and this one even sounded better than the marshall simualtion built in ) , and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped , fantastic ! speaking of joyo , i ' ve had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from moen , another chinese pedal maker , and i ' m honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag ( especially the&nbsp <a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/moen-mo-fm-fuzz-moo/dp/b007l5pvi8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8>moen mo-fm fuzz moo</a>&nbsp which honestly out big muffs every big muff i ' ve ever played through ) . so joyo and moen , they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz , od , and dirt pedals , check them out ( and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a chinese company , please keep in mind that none of the pedals listed in my review , ds-1 included , are made in america , let alone the western hemisphere ) . hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for . also , if you can ' t actually try a pedal out at the store , youtube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do . i should also mention that if you try and love the ds-1 and it suits your needs , than more power to you . tone is subjective , every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps , and just because i may share different opinions on something that you love , that ' s okay . my main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information . you have plenty of options for distortion pedals , the ds-1 is not the only thing out there that ' s affordable . find something you truly love and buy that . if its the ds-1 , one of the pedals i ' ve mentioned here , or anything else , the important part is that it sounds right to you .\n",

            "Text: the reason for my rating of 4 stars is i evaluated these headphones in 2 different applications -- 5 stars for comfortable sound isolation when recording an instrument in a noisy environment . no , they are not as sound isolating as an in-ear headphone , but they also don ' t give you that music inside your head effect that in-ear monitors give you . 3 stars for sound accuracy . for those who like to mix using headphones , i would caution against using these headphones unless you are comparing to a mix you like the sound of and can then do a side-by-side comparison during the mixing process . why do i say this ? these headphones seem to be a bit heavy in the bass and low mids and seem to have a drop off in treble starting around 6k . this is sometimes a common trait in closed headphones as compared to semi-open . this tends to give a bit boomy and muffled tone . nothing extreme , but they will not have a flat and balanced tone for mixing like classics like the akg 240 headphones or yamaha ns10m studio nearfield monitors . since the story behind these headphones involves them being designed by a drummer , this may explain this tone bias .\n",

( back to the days of 1200 baud modems ! ) overall , it ' s an easy to use tool with pretty good results . we weren ' t huge fans of the vocal harmony feature , but everything else worked well enough to make this a useable tool that would benefit live vocalists looking to clean up and enhance their sound .\n",

            "Text: while i ' ll be the first to admit that i ' m a bit biased and that i really don ' t care for gimmicks as i ' ve seen many come and go , however after having recently tried these strings i have to honestly say - i ' m just not impressed . the only thing i can assume is that since these typically cost 2 - 3 times more than traditional strings , some people apparently assume they must somehow be better . . . after all , if it costs more , it must be better . . . right ? not always . . . . . . first and foremost , i ' ll address the sound . . . after all , that is the single greatest factor regarding a guitar string . while longevity and playability are important factors , if a guitar string doesn ' t sound good , the other two issues are pretty meaningless . i recently played these strings on both a martin , as well as on a seagull to provide a fair and objective comparison , to my ear , right out of the box they sound very artificial , if not acoustically dead . . . these just don ' t have the sparkle that you would expect from a more traditional acoustic guitar string . the nearest i can figure is that the coating prevents the string from vibrating correctly . . . it seems to dampen the rich harmonic overtones you would normally associate with a vibrating guitar string , much the way dirt and rust do on older strings . i suspect there are folks who prefer this to the rich , lively , vibrant sound of fresh strings , however i don ' t . as a person who plays very regularly ( often as much as 2 -3 hours per day or more when i ' m gigging ) , i do change my strings often and the sound of a fresh , traditional guitar string is just much more appealing . very simply , even if these strings were more realistically priced , i would not use them again based on this issue alone . likewise , while some folks seem to like the feel of these strings , i didn ' t . perhaps it ' s simply that i play regularly enough that my calluses are built up to the point that regular guitar strings don ' t bother me ( it should go with the turf ) . possibly its a result of my playing both electrics and acoustics on a regular basis and it could simply even be the number of years i ' ve been playing ( well over 30 as of this writing ) and that i ' m just very used to traditional guitar strings . regardless , personally i found the feel of these strings to be rather distracting . . . they just don ' t feel like guitar strings to my fingers . i suspect that if these were the only guitar strings available , given time i would eventually get used to the feel , however i simply found myself thinking more about how annoying they were than i did about my playing . . . not a good thing for a performing musician . in fairness , i can ' t speak much to the longevity of these strings as they were removed and replaced with a set of ernie ball earthwood ' s after only a few days ( 2 sets of elixirs around $15 a pop . . . yea - serious waste of money there ) . while it seems most unlikely , it could be possible that these somehow improve with age , perhaps as that coating wears off . . . but i doubt it . either way , i can ' t provide any details as to how long they might last under normal playing conditions . . . . i just couldn ' t force myself to put up with them that long to find out . as with so many things related to guitars ( or music as a whole ) , guitar strings are of course , a very personal choice and everyone has their own tastes and preferences . in my many years as a musician , i ' ve probably played every brand of guitar string out there at one point or another and certainly there are some brands that i do very much tend to favor ( such as ghs boomers for my electrics ) . with that in mind , i can ' t see these elixir strings as anything but a gimmick . . . between the poor sound , the annoying feel and the truly exorbitant price , seriously . . . i ' ll stick with ernie balls .\n",

Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

' s wife for example she ' s so worried about preparing for death , not in some religiously way , but in a far too practical , even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile , laugh and just have a good time . her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie mode . , to the contrary , is perhaps too and absent-minded for his own good . he needs a person like his wife , , to help balance him . it ' s as though possesses the invincible spirit of a child , like a kid trapped in an older man ' s body . he is introduced as the adventurous type he pretends to be people he ' s not in order to get gain , money , lies and is always up for a good laugh . , though , he is a and gentle old man who wishes to be to his overly pragmatic wife . the two off-set each other quite nicely , though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death meaning , their divorce . it is during this scene that realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love . his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws , yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior . in this moment of her forgiving him , realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy . ironically , though , after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls , a living corpse . the within him drains away as he becomes more like zombie going through day-to-day motions . he doesn ' t seem to live anymore , but exist . for example , he gives up his pranks , doesn ' t money , quits smoking on account of his wife ( not his health ) , and overall , just to whatever she wants of him . succinctly put , he changes on account of wanting to make her happy . thus , the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish . realizing that her husband is not who he used to be , there is a part of that misses the old . she misses her husband ' s and the fights they used to have , because it was in those moments that they were truly living , not just simply existing . i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient , but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times . the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment . life is often taken for granted , but when threatened with it literal or awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are to start living life to its fullest . it ' s as though they are scared that they ' ll never live again , so they better make the most of it while they have it . and had been married 44 years with fights along the way , but it wasn ' t till they were both threatened with the possibility of that they began to show their true colors . as the old maxim goes , love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation . they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way . more importantly , the intimate relationships they make with their significant others .\n",

( it ' s not until the camera views fully , pulls back and we see his long , slender legs , that we realize he is not a boy , but an adolescent -- at first we ' re forced to question ' s attraction in an uncomfortable way visconti must have known that , and he doesn ' t shy away from it . ) visconti is extremely patient with we get a sense of the man , we know him . it ' s a largely silent performance , and when he does open his mouth it ' s to spew venom no wonder he wants the angelic , boy to project himself onto . there ' s a difference with ( we never know him , just as we never know a handful of fellini but that ' s because his life is another , its own film ) , but it ' s not as as it ' s been made to seem ( there is one scene , however , where he twirls around a pole that ' s too much ) . isn ' t necessarily leading him on -- he ' s looking at him visconti just zooms in is all . the film doesn ' t detail as being gay -- isn ' t even really male , he ' s a version of a boy ( delicate , pale , wispy , with golden locks ) that everyone seems to love ( including one gorgeous , slightly older young man who he with ) . the closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to ' s is the famous barber scene , which unlocks his vanity . it isn ' t totally successful -- the whole section with alfred is a waste , and some unnecessary scenes , people carrying bags in long shot , could have been . some parts are heavy-handed , such as when ' s boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by -- the looks on his face are too obvious . ( but during the same scene throws a fit , wanting a new , something so that it makes up for it . ) but there are some scenes -- touching for the first time -- that build up a remarkable , quiet intensity . repeating a piano song again and again , the notes in the air , may be the best example of the anxiety the film has . there is one discussion that contains a debate i ' m especially interested can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses , or does it have to go beyond them ? ( we can consider , who both visconti and , to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory . ) i think this one manages to do both . 9/10\n",

' ' doesn ' t really stray too far from this territory , but its first two acts are the perfect example of the thriller , and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn . when the penny does drop , and is let loose to play the bad guy , the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don ' t quite live up to rest of the movie . that said , the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold . the fight is over , but the scars will always be there . much of the narration ( provided by a somewhat whiny , pre ) is a tad . of course , it ' s meant to be from the book the ' s journalist character has written , so one could argue that the narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of style in which most journalists write . the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the of the past twenty years . highly recommended , but not for the weak of stomach or mind . this film is disturbing on more than one level . but then , it ' s meant to be .\n",

( i demand that our conversation be pleasant ! ! ! ) and the color values tended to shift violently from shot to shot , as if cheap film stock and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day . ( note - this last may have been the fault of a bad print , rather than the camera crew ) . but there were a couple of nice moments here and there . the makeup effects were startlingly good in contrast to the rest of the film , the actors were looked interesting , especially the mute girl and the . and in spite of everything , there was a definite creepy atmosphere to be found , very nasty and disturbing . so what was the deal with this movie ? i thought about it a bit , and realized that pat basically tried to put a story from of the old ec horror comics on film . that would account for the dialog , the sketchy character development ( in a comic , = character even more than in film ) , the loopy interior logic of the story ( ec horror stories went out of their way to include a nasty shock ending and weren ' t big on psychological realism ) , the over reliance on the narrative voice ( which belongs in over the panels ) , and the interesting makeup effects that mimicked the pictures that the old ec artists did so well . in fact , i ' d be willing to bet that when saw his leading man during casting , he instantly saw that the fellow was as close to being the equivalent of the lanky , figures and caved in faces that artists like johnny craig and jack davis drew as an actual human could be and still exist in the real world . . he used and lighting to emphasize the cartoony aspect of the visuals and turned everyone into living ec comics characters . ( see the leading lady ' s blank beauty , the count ' s strong bony features , oddly bronze skin and sharp chin , the platinum ' do on the tall , bony black , etc . ) this would explain the movie ' s failings . knew how to ' frame ' things , but he didn ' t know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies . knew how to tell a creepy story within the confines of a comics page , but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him . he wouldn ' t be the first person with this problem of course - look at what joel did to batman . but he didn ' t have a big budget to hide behind . in any case , i ' m imagine that walked away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about of the folks who post on this film ' s message boards . he did , within certainly vague boundaries , what he set out to do , and you have to respect him for it . . . even if you don ' t care for .\n",

' s character is arrogant ( and guessing from her role as stand-up and is in real life too ) . she claims that the film is when in fact it ' s just realistic . men more often than not go for looks over personality . it ' s interesting to note her too . she ' d been a and for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad . i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film . i mean come on ! she acted in it for heaven ' s sake ! what this film was really was if anything . it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of ' s character . there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin ' s character being the british man every american girl finds cute and foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure . is that the best the script writers could come up with ? they ' ve never done that before except with every hugh grant and moore film ever made . there ' s also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is . the other comments on here all say how isn ' t ugly but is actually beautiful . erm was i watching the same film as they were ? she ' s certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one . although having said that , i fail to see the appeal of as well she ' s lanky and looking . i guarantee three things about this film if you ' ve never watched it you will know what the ending will be you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and you will be bored after ten minutes . watch at your own peril .\n",

' s wife for example she ' s so worried about preparing for death , not in some religiously way , but in a far too practical , even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile , laugh and just have a good time . her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie mode . , to the contrary , is perhaps too and absent-minded for his own good . he needs a person like his wife , , to help balance him . it ' s as though possesses the invincible spirit of a child , like a kid trapped in an older man ' s body . he is introduced as the adventurous type he pretends to be people he ' s not in order to get gain , money , lies and is always up for a good laugh . , though , he is a and gentle old man who wishes to be to his overly pragmatic wife . the two off-set each other quite nicely , though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death meaning , their divorce . it is during this scene that realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love . his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws , yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior . in this moment of her forgiving him , realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy . ironically , though , after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls , a living corpse . the within him drains away as he becomes more like zombie going through day-to-day motions . he doesn ' t seem to live anymore , but exist . for example , he gives up his pranks , doesn ' t money , quits smoking on account of his wife ( not his health ) , and overall , just to whatever she wants of him . succinctly put , he changes on account of wanting to make her happy . thus , the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish . realizing that her husband is not who he used to be , there is a part of that misses the old . she misses her husband ' s and the fights they used to have , because it was in those moments that they were truly living , not just simply existing . i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient , but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times . the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment . life is often taken for granted , but when threatened with it literal or awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are to start living life to its fullest . it ' s as though they are scared that they ' ll never live again , so they better make the most of it while they have it . and had been married 44 years with fights along the way , but it wasn ' t till they were both threatened with the possibility of that they began to show their true colors . as the old maxim goes , love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation . they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way . more importantly , the intimate relationships they make with their significant others .\n",

( the crew includes both the big guy and a midget ) how did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal ? and most puzzling is why are they in drag ? they are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women ? i mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other .

' ' doesn ' t really stray too far from this territory , but its first two acts are the perfect example of the thriller , and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn . when the penny does drop , and is let loose to play the bad guy , the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don ' t quite live up to rest of the movie . that said , the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold . the fight is over , but the scars will always be there . much of the narration ( provided by a somewhat whiny , pre ) is a tad . of course , it ' s meant to be from the book the ' s journalist character has written , so one could argue that the narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of style in which most journalists write . the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the of the past twenty years . highly recommended , but not for the weak of stomach or mind . this film is disturbing on more than one level . but then , it ' s meant to be .\n",

            "Text: this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it isn ' t on any of her collections . the reason why is probably because it doesn ' t have a happy ending , unlike all her other films . its also not a musical , although she does belt out one song called ' the world owes me a living ' . the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white , the version i have is in colour and on vhs , i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic , unlike i would say the films of laurel and hardy which are dreadful . the film is good for its age and the story hasn ' t dated at all , i ' m surprised no one has tried to do a remake . at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole seem really dragged out , in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five . although don ' t be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it , especially when cooper steals a necklace , and hides it in shirley ' s teddy bear . the tension and slow build up to his actions , at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another very well directed . gary and edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good . in all this is a good film from the early 30 ' s , accept it for its age .\n",

( i demand that our conversation be pleasant ! ! ! ) and the color values tended to shift violently from shot to shot , as if cheap film stock and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day . ( note - this last may have been the fault of a bad print , rather than the camera crew ) . but there were a couple of nice moments here and there . the makeup effects were startlingly good in contrast to the rest of the film , the actors were looked interesting , especially the mute girl and the . and in spite of everything , there was a definite creepy atmosphere to be found , very nasty and disturbing . so what was the deal with this movie ? i thought about it a bit , and realized that pat basically tried to put a story from of the old ec horror comics on film . that would account for the dialog , the sketchy character development ( in a comic , = character even more than in film ) , the loopy interior logic of the story ( ec horror stories went out of their way to include a nasty shock ending and weren ' t big on psychological realism ) , the over reliance on the narrative voice ( which belongs in over the panels ) , and the interesting makeup effects that mimicked the pictures that the old ec artists did so well . in fact , i ' d be willing to bet that when saw his leading man during casting , he instantly saw that the fellow was as close to being the equivalent of the lanky , figures and caved in faces that artists like johnny craig and jack davis drew as an actual human could be and still exist in the real world . . he used and lighting to emphasize the cartoony aspect of the visuals and turned everyone into living ec comics characters .

( neil flanagan ) that request a meeting so he can read their late father ' s will . informs them that they must spend three days in their childhood home ' house ' and fill it with ' sexual harmony and love ' that it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother . he informs the couples that the will is highly irregular but legal . after three days the will be settled . the couples are also told about the , ( ) , ( maggie ) and the retarded , who welcomes the couples by killing and biting chunks out of a rabbit in front of them . later on that night whats left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples beds with a note that says ' blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit ' . this starts a series of events which end in murder and reveals dark family secrets . , photographed and directed by the talentless andy . this is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible . lets go through just some of it ' s faults . the music , it ' s awful and headache inducing . sound , you can barely hear what characters are saying and certain scenes don ' t have any sound effects plus at certain points you can hear shouting out orders to his actors , oh and there ' s a constant hiss on the soundtrack throughout as well . the acting , probably among the worst i have ever witnessed . the very effects , pokes someones eye out in the opening sequence , it ' s the size of a tennis ball , the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened up with a saw looks really awful as are the various hands and legs that are chopped off . photography , has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene , he regularly cuts the top , bottom or sides of peoples heads and faces off the screen and his camera jerks and shakes around like it ' s operated by someone who is constantly tripping over . there is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen . the film is often so dark you can ' t see whats happening , too . editing , again some of the worst i ' ve ever sat through , he seems to cut scenes before they ' ve finished , cutting away while characters are in the middle of a sentence . the script , if there was one , credited to both and hal sherwood ( it took two people to write this ! ? ) is all over the place and is incredibly stupid . there is one unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down into the basement , the killer walks right behind him , at one point the potential victim turns around . what does the killer do to avoid being spotted ? they duck down right in from of him , the killers close enough to give the guy oral sex yet he doesn ' t notice them , right in front of him . you have to see this sequence to believe it , i still can ' t believe what i saw . bizarre sub plots just happen and then totally disappear , check the scene out when richard has to borrow money from his brother walter ( producer and co-writer hal sherwood ) , who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an relationship with his brother before he was married ! a strange scene that ' s there for no reason at all . the reaction to the first murder , she ' s more bothered by the fact that it ' s thrown her dinner schedule out ! there ' s load of insane dialogue as well , patty and discuss , patty says if only i didn ' t beat him so hard sympathetically replies you have to patty , you have to ! , delivered totally straight faced . and don ' t start me on how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house ! the only good thing i can think of saying is that the look reasonable , for the time period it ' s meant to be set in . i could probably go on all day about how amateurish this is , but i think you get the idea . one to avoid unless your a serious masochist ! i didn ' t regret buying or watching it for a second , though !\n",
